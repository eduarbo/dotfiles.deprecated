# Mein dotfiles

A tidy `$HOME` is a tidy mind.

These are my dotfiles, designed primarily for macOS and Fedora, heavily inspired
by [hlissner/dotfiles](https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles). They are my
specific breed of madness, split into 2-level topics (e.g. `shell/zsh`) that
strive for minimum `$HOME` presence (adhering to XDG standards where
possible).

## Quick start

`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eduarbo/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh)`

## What does it include?

The following are the categories and topics available to install:

```
.
├── base/                ## provisions my system with the bare essentials
│   ├── macos/            # bare essentials for macOS
│   └── fedora/           # bare essentials for Fedora
|
├── dev/                 ## relevant to software development & programming in general
│   ├── lua/              # manage lua environments with luaenv
│   ├── python/           # setup pyenv, a simple Python version management
│   └── node/             # setup nodenv, a lightweight alternative to nvm
|
├── editor/              ## configuration for my text editors
│   ├── editorconfig/     # maintain consistent coding styles between different editors
│   └── emacs/            # the best of both the Emacs and Vim worlds
|
├── misc/                ## for various apps & tools
│   ├── apps/             # macOS apps and utilities
│   ├── cvim/             # Vim-like bindings for Google Chrome
│   ├── hammerspoon/      # a bunch of lua scripts for macOS to boost my productivity
│   ├── iterm/            # iTerm2, is there a better macOS terminal?
│   └── karabiner/        # absolutely amazing macOS app that lets me remap completely my keyboard
│
└── shell/               ## shell utilities
    ├── bash/             # Not my default shell but doesn't hurt to have a basic config
    ├── git/              # nice aliases and zsh plugins
    ├── sk/               # faster than fzf, Skim it's Fuzzy Finder in rust!
    ├── tmux/             # window manager within the terminal + nice plugins
    └── zsh/              # My shell of choice with a nice prompt, really fast and extensible with zplugin
```

## Dotfile management

```
Usage: deploy [-acdlLit] [TOPIC...]

  -a   Target all enabled topics (ignores TOPIC args)
  -c   Afterwards, remove dead symlinks & empty dot-directories in $HOME.
       Can be used alone.
  -d   Unlink and run `./_init clean` for topic(s)
  -l   Only relink topic(s) (implies -i)
  -L   List enabled topics
  -i   Inhibit install/update/clean init scripts
  -t   Do a test run; do not actually do anything
```

e.g.
+ `deploy base/macos shell/{zsh,tmux}`: enables base/macos, shell/zsh & shell/tmux
+ `deploy -d shell/zsh`: disables shell/zsh & cleans up after it
+ `deploy -l shell/zsh`: refresh links for shell/zsh (inhibits init script)
+ `deploy -l`: relink all enabled topics
+ `deploy -L`: list all enabled topics

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

``` sh
cd $topic
if [[ -L $DOTFILES_DATA/${topic//\//.}.topic ]]; then
    ./_init update
else
    ln -sfv $DOTFILES/$topic $DOTFILES_DATA/${topic//\//.}.topic

    ./_init install
    ./_init link
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Signing Git commit with GPG ask passphrase everytime

Make sure the GPG key ID is correct. You can get a list of GPG keys with
`gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG` and then set it in Git with
`git config --global user.signingkey [GPG-key-ID]`.

More details in [Telling Git about your GPG key](https://help.github.com/articles/telling-git-about-your-gpg-key/).
