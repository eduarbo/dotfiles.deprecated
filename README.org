#+TITLE: My dotfiles

This is a collection of my configuration files under OSX and Linux (WIP)

** What does it include?

- alfred :: Preferences and workflows. Better than spotlight in many ways
- apps :: Installs a collection of macOS apps
- bash :: Nice prompt, aliases and ENV variables
- fonts :: All my favorite fonts
- git :: Global git config, gitignore and aliases
- gnupg :: gpg and gpg-agent config files with support for SSH authentication
- hammerspoon :: configs to use it as tiling window manager and launcher
- iterm :: Preferences for my favorite terminal in macos
- karabiner & seil :: settings to customize my keyboard layout
- kwm :: A real tiling window manager for macos
- scripts :: Collection of useful scripts like backup, macosdefaults, etc
- spacemacs :: My main editor, the best of vim and emacs in one place
- tmux :: Terminal multiplexer with a powerline-like status bar
- utils :: Collection of macOS and Linux cli utils
- vim :: Minimal setup to edit files quickly now that my main editor is emacs
- zsh :: zshell settings, nice prompt, plugins and more

** How to install
Each directory works as a package. When you install a package it symlinks the
config files, resolves missing dependencies listed in the ~deps~ file, and setup
the package.

1) Clone the repo: ~git clone https://github.com/eduarbo/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles~
2) Change working directory to dotfiles: ~cd ~/.dotfiles~
3) Install desired packages with the ~install~ script: ~./install zsh spacemacs
   vim gnupg~
