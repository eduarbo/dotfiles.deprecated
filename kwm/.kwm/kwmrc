/*
This is a sample config for Kwm

The following statements can be used to set Kwms internal directory structure.

    This is the root folder for Kwms files, the only thing this actually
    specifies is the location of the 'init' script which Kwm runs upon startup.
    Defaults to $HOME/.kwm

        kwm_home /path/to/.kwm

    This is the root folder in which all files included using 'include' must reside.
    Defaults to $HOME/.kwm

        kwm_include /path/to/.kwm/include

    This is the folder in which all bsp-layouts managed by 'tree load' and 'tree save'
    is loaded from / saved to. Defaults to $HOME/.kwm/layouts

        kwm_layouts /path/to/.kwm/layouts

Commands prefixed with 'kwmc' will call
local functions corresponding to the
kwmc syntax.

To run an external program or command,
use the prefix 'exec' followed by command.
e.g 'exec mvim' would open macvim

Read file and execute commands as
if they were written inside kwmrc.

e.g: window-rules in a separate file called 'rules'
